ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings and Vector databases are
ySus5ZS0b94,essential if you're building any type of
ySus5ZS0b94,AI product in this video I'll go over
ySus5ZS0b94,what they are and how to use them with
ySus5ZS0b94,open Ai and their apis I'll cover this
ySus5ZS0b94,in three parts I'll explain the theory
ySus5ZS0b94,then the use and finally integration
ySus5ZS0b94,after watching this video you'll be able
ySus5ZS0b94,to create long-term memory for a chat
ySus5ZS0b94,GPT or perform semantic searches based
ySus5ZS0b94,on a huge database of PDFs connected
ySus5ZS0b94,directly to an AI let's start there are
ySus5ZS0b94,two terms I'll cover embeddings and
ySus5ZS0b94,Vector databases they work together I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,begin with embeddings what are
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings to put it simply an embedding
ySus5ZS0b94,is data like words that have been
ySus5ZS0b94,converted into an array of numbers known
ySus5ZS0b94,as a vector that contains patterns of
ySus5ZS0b94,relationships the combination of these
ySus5ZS0b94,numbers that make up the vector act as a
ySus5ZS0b94,multi-dimensional map to measure
ySus5ZS0b94,similarity for a simple example let me
ySus5ZS0b94,describe a 2d graph the words dog and
ySus5ZS0b94,puppy are often used in similar
ySus5ZS0b94,situations so in a word embedding they
ySus5ZS0b94,would be represented by vectors that are
ySus5ZS0b94,close together well this is a simple 2D
ySus5ZS0b94,example of a single dimension in reality
ySus5ZS0b94,the vector has hundreds of Dimensions
ySus5ZS0b94,that cover the rich multi-dimensional
ySus5ZS0b94,complex relationship between words
ySus5ZS0b94,images can also be turned into vectors
ySus5ZS0b94,too and it's how Google does similar
ySus5ZS0b94,image searches the image sections are
ySus5ZS0b94,broken down into arrays of numbers
ySus5ZS0b94,allowing you to find patterns of
ySus5ZS0b94,similarity for those with closely
ySus5ZS0b94,resembling vectors once an embedding is
ySus5ZS0b94,created it can be stored in a database a
ySus5ZS0b94,database full of these is considered a
ySus5ZS0b94,vector database and can be used in
ySus5ZS0b94,several ways including searching where
ySus5ZS0b94,results are ranked by relevance to a
ySus5ZS0b94,query string or clustering where text
ySus5ZS0b94,strings are grouped by similarity and
ySus5ZS0b94,recommendations where items with related
ySus5ZS0b94,text strings are recommended also
ySus5ZS0b94,classification where text strings are
ySus5ZS0b94,classified by their most similar label
ySus5ZS0b94,for the purpose of this video I'm going
ySus5ZS0b94,to just cover searching since it would
ySus5ZS0b94,be the most commonly used there are many
ySus5ZS0b94,practical ways to do this but open AI
ySus5ZS0b94,has provided a great AI model to
ySus5ZS0b94,specifically create embeddings it does
ySus5ZS0b94,not however provide a way to store them
ySus5ZS0b94,which we will be using a cloud database
ySus5ZS0b94,for later in the video now let's start
ySus5ZS0b94,making an embedding by accessing open AI
ySus5ZS0b94,on the Google page I'm going to browse
ySus5ZS0b94,open AI I'm going to head over to the
ySus5ZS0b94,open AI website where I can create a new
ySus5ZS0b94,account or log into an existing one
ySus5ZS0b94,which is what I'm gonna do it's free if
ySus5ZS0b94,you want to sign up I'm going to log in
ySus5ZS0b94,using my Google credentials and I'll be
ySus5ZS0b94,taken to a few options here between chat
ySus5ZS0b94,gbt Dali and other apis I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,head over to their API page and this
ySus5ZS0b94,will take me to the dashboard here I
ySus5ZS0b94,want to start off having a look at the
ySus5ZS0b94,documentation on the embeddings which
ySus5ZS0b94,you can find just over here and I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,also link this in the description but
ySus5ZS0b94,what we're going to start off with is
ySus5ZS0b94,creating some API requests for
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings themselves in order to do
ySus5ZS0b94,that we're going to head over to the API
ySus5ZS0b94,references page here under embeddings is
ySus5ZS0b94,all the information to create one and
ySus5ZS0b94,it's quite simple it's as easy as doing
ySus5ZS0b94,a single post request with some inputs
ySus5ZS0b94,and getting a response back we could
ySus5ZS0b94,write code to do this or do it inside of
ySus5ZS0b94,a terminal but the easiest way is inside
ySus5ZS0b94,of some GUI software and this is called
ySus5ZS0b94,Postman it's an API platform and it's
ySus5ZS0b94,also the sponsor for today's video
ySus5ZS0b94,Postman is a piece of software and also
ySus5ZS0b94,a web app that's entirely free that
ySus5ZS0b94,allows you to do all sorts of API
ySus5ZS0b94,requests it's quite easy to get running
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm using Windows so I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,download the windows version of the
ySus5ZS0b94,application here I've launched it the
ySus5ZS0b94,first thing I'm going to do is create a
ySus5ZS0b94,workspace for my API queries this I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to call open AI Vector database
ySus5ZS0b94,there are a few different types of
ySus5ZS0b94,workspaces between personal private but
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm going to select the team one because
ySus5ZS0b94,this allows me to share out my workspace
ySus5ZS0b94,to other people in the future if I
ySus5ZS0b94,wanted to for this new workspace I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to open up a new tab kind of like
ySus5ZS0b94,Chrome here I've got a few different
ySus5ZS0b94,options but the main one here is the
ySus5ZS0b94,type of request which can be a get post
ySus5ZS0b94,push I'm going to do a post request and
ySus5ZS0b94,here I'm going to get the URL that we're
ySus5ZS0b94,going to be using for the embeddings
ySus5ZS0b94,which is just down here and it's the
ySus5ZS0b94,api.openai forward slash version one
ySus5ZS0b94,forward slash embeddings URL I'm going
ySus5ZS0b94,to paste this here in the URL section
ySus5ZS0b94,and what's useful is that Postman is
ySus5ZS0b94,telling me that I do need authorization
ySus5ZS0b94,to use this endpoint for an API I also
ySus5ZS0b94,have the instructions on how to generate
ySus5ZS0b94,one so I'm going to head over to this
ySus5ZS0b94,open AI API Keys page and on this page I
ySus5ZS0b94,can select it to create a new secret key
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm going to label this embeddings and
ySus5ZS0b94,then I'm going to generate it make sure
ySus5ZS0b94,you keep this key private I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,copy and paste this into Postman and
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll place it here in the API key
ySus5ZS0b94,section be aware Postman allows any type
ySus5ZS0b94,of authorization we're using the bearer
ySus5ZS0b94,token which is how open AI authenticates
ySus5ZS0b94,with all this setup we can now create
ySus5ZS0b94,our first embedding which is the easiest
ySus5ZS0b94,part on the open AI website under create
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings all the information to create
ySus5ZS0b94,a request is available it only really
ySus5ZS0b94,needs two things the model as well as
ySus5ZS0b94,the input for the model in this example
ySus5ZS0b94,we'll be using open ai's text embedding
ySus5ZS0b94,using ada002 which is also the cheapest
ySus5ZS0b94,version and for the input it can be any
ySus5ZS0b94,type of text so here on Postman I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,gonna head over to create this body
ySus5ZS0b94,request under the body I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,select to pass in some raw information
ySus5ZS0b94,and this will be in the form of a Json
ySus5ZS0b94,object I'll add in some curly brackets
ySus5ZS0b94,and here I'm going to pass in the string
ySus5ZS0b94,for the model as well as the string for
ySus5ZS0b94,the input in true programming fashion
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll have this input say hello world and
ySus5ZS0b94,that's it all that's left is to send
ySus5ZS0b94,this post request to open Ai and its API
ySus5ZS0b94,and here's the response we've created
ySus5ZS0b94,our first embedding quite easy and this
ySus5ZS0b94,is also the vector for the embedding
ySus5ZS0b94,down here and if you preview it it quite
ySus5ZS0b94,a lot of numbers let me now show a few
ySus5ZS0b94,different types of examples of
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings that could be created there
ySus5ZS0b94,are single word embeddings these are
ySus5ZS0b94,things like dog or cat where the
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding is a single word and the
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding Vector is generated when it's
ySus5ZS0b94,sent to open AI these would be used in
ySus5ZS0b94,situations where you might want to
ySus5ZS0b94,perform a search you can do multi-word
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings too so I could for example
ySus5ZS0b94,have a small sentence like open AI
ySus5ZS0b94,vectors and embeddings are easy and this
ySus5ZS0b94,creates a more nuanced embedding but for
ySus5ZS0b94,the most part it looks the same to us
ySus5ZS0b94,humans the strength of embeddings is
ySus5ZS0b94,where you chunk large bits of
ySus5ZS0b94,information together such as paragraphs
ySus5ZS0b94,or entire sections of documents to
ySus5ZS0b94,create an embedding that can be then
ySus5ZS0b94,later drawn upon when you search a
ySus5ZS0b94,database and for some useful information
ySus5ZS0b94,Ada version 2 allows for a maximum input
ySus5ZS0b94,of 8 000 tokens more or less which is
ySus5ZS0b94,around 30 000 letters or characters and
ySus5ZS0b94,to give you an idea of how much that is
ySus5ZS0b94,a page from a contract or a legal
ySus5ZS0b94,document can be up to about 3 000
ySus5ZS0b94,characters on a single page this means
ySus5ZS0b94,you could probably embed about 10 pages
ySus5ZS0b94,in a single request to give you an idea
ySus5ZS0b94,of what this looks like a let me copy
ySus5ZS0b94,paste this entire page from this NDA
ySus5ZS0b94,contract then I'm going to jump into
ySus5ZS0b94,Postman and paste this here into the
ySus5ZS0b94,input removing any line breaks or
ySus5ZS0b94,additional spaces this gives you an idea
ySus5ZS0b94,of just how much is being currently
ySus5ZS0b94,embedded and this embed request takes
ySus5ZS0b94,just about as much time as a single word
ySus5ZS0b94,now that we can create embeddings we
ySus5ZS0b94,need to store them somewhere openai
ySus5ZS0b94,doesn't provide databases so we'll need
ySus5ZS0b94,to create our own and a database full of
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings is often referred to as a
ySus5ZS0b94,vector database I'm going to use a
ySus5ZS0b94,provider called a single store they
ySus5ZS0b94,provide a real-time unified distributed
ySus5ZS0b94,SQL database which also is quite easy to
ySus5ZS0b94,use since it's in the cloud and on top
ySus5ZS0b94,of that they allow for you to
ySus5ZS0b94,incorporate Vector databases straight in
ySus5ZS0b94,there so what we'll do is set up a
ySus5ZS0b94,database and we'll start storing our
ySus5ZS0b94,embeddings and then also start searching
ySus5ZS0b94,through them first you'll want to set up
ySus5ZS0b94,an account it's free and comes with
ySus5ZS0b94,additional credit as well as the ability
ySus5ZS0b94,to set up unlimited databases I already
ySus5ZS0b94,have an account so I'm just going to
ySus5ZS0b94,sign in via Google on the main dashboard
ySus5ZS0b94,the first thing you'll want to do is
ySus5ZS0b94,create a workspace and in here we'll
ySus5ZS0b94,soon create a database for your
ySus5ZS0b94,workspace you can call it anything in
ySus5ZS0b94,mind I'm going to call it open AI Vector
ySus5ZS0b94,database I'm going to select the cloud
ySus5ZS0b94,platform for AWS but you can also select
ySus5ZS0b94,a Google or Microsoft Azure platform and
ySus5ZS0b94,for the region I would recommend just
ySus5ZS0b94,picking the one that's closest to you
ySus5ZS0b94,but I'm just going to leave it to the
ySus5ZS0b94,default on us West next I'll select the
ySus5ZS0b94,button next on this page I can set how
ySus5ZS0b94,fast the workspace is how many CPUs how
ySus5ZS0b94,much RAM it has but for this tutorial
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm not going to do much I'm just going
ySus5ZS0b94,to keep it at the bare minimum I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,leave the advanced settings as the
ySus5ZS0b94,default and select next this workstation
ySus5ZS0b94,will set up in the background and once
ySus5ZS0b94,complete I'm going to create a database
ySus5ZS0b94,on it let me close these info panels
ySus5ZS0b94,here we'll have the workspace on the
ySus5ZS0b94,left hand side and on the right side I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to select create a database I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to name this database open AI
ySus5ZS0b94,database and then select to create it
ySus5ZS0b94,once it's created it'll show up here in
ySus5ZS0b94,the interface and I can select to view
ySus5ZS0b94,it it doesn't have any tables or data
ySus5ZS0b94,just now so what we'll do next is head
ySus5ZS0b94,over to the SQL editor where we can run
ySus5ZS0b94,some simple commands to create a table
ySus5ZS0b94,and then input some data make sure that
ySus5ZS0b94,on the top you have selected the
ySus5ZS0b94,database you're currently using so in
ySus5ZS0b94,this case I'm going to select the
ySus5ZS0b94,database open AI database and now I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to write a simple SQL query it'll
ySus5ZS0b94,be create table if not exist and I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,have the name of the table as my table
ySus5ZS0b94,actually I'll do my Vector table here in
ySus5ZS0b94,Brackets I'm then going to put in the
ySus5ZS0b94,different types of columns I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,have the first will be the text the
ySus5ZS0b94,original text as a text type the next
ySus5ZS0b94,will be the vector and the vector will
ySus5ZS0b94,be a blob type you can have different
ySus5ZS0b94,types such as integers and numbers and
ySus5ZS0b94,decimals and you can even have a larger
ySus5ZS0b94,table with things like an ID and other
ySus5ZS0b94,attributes like a URL but I'm keeping
ySus5ZS0b94,this nice and simple for this demo let's
ySus5ZS0b94,run this command and this has created
ySus5ZS0b94,the table here we can see a logged below
ySus5ZS0b94,I can head into the database and select
ySus5ZS0b94,it and view the table additionally I can
ySus5ZS0b94,view the different columns as well as
ySus5ZS0b94,the data type additionally I can head
ySus5ZS0b94,over to sample.2 have a look at the rows
ySus5ZS0b94,which don't exist yet let's create our
ySus5ZS0b94,first row and insert a vector into this
ySus5ZS0b94,database what I'm going to do is open up
ySus5ZS0b94,the SQL editor in here I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,write some new syntax to insert a row
ySus5ZS0b94,this is insert into the table name which
ySus5ZS0b94,is a my Vector table then in Brackets
ySus5ZS0b94,text and Vector being the two attributes
ySus5ZS0b94,we want to fill and then the values for
ySus5ZS0b94,those which in the this case will be the
ySus5ZS0b94,ones that we have in Postman so I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to open up a postman here I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to copy out of this input hello
ySus5ZS0b94,world and I'm going to paste this here
ySus5ZS0b94,into the values next I'll put in the
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding here I'm going to pass in Json
ySus5ZS0b94,underscore array underscore pack which
ySus5ZS0b94,is necessary to turn it into this blob
ySus5ZS0b94,structure and in here I'm going to pass
ySus5ZS0b94,in the string of the array this is in
ySus5ZS0b94,Postman here under embedding and it's
ySus5ZS0b94,this huge block of numbers I'll select
ySus5ZS0b94,to copy all of them and then here in the
ySus5ZS0b94,interface I'll paste them back in and
ySus5ZS0b94,that's it now I simply have to run the
ySus5ZS0b94,command and this should enter this
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding into the vector database which
ySus5ZS0b94,it just has here we can see the results
ySus5ZS0b94,one row added and if I head over to the
ySus5ZS0b94,open AI database under my Vector table
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll be able to see under sample data
ySus5ZS0b94,this a new row has been added now it's
ySus5ZS0b94,time to add some more data because we
ySus5ZS0b94,can't really have a database with just a
ySus5ZS0b94,single row what I'm going to do is is
ySus5ZS0b94,head back to postman search through the
ySus5ZS0b94,history of all the posts we've done so
ySus5ZS0b94,far and pull out some of these examples
ySus5ZS0b94,to place in as a rose inside of the
ySus5ZS0b94,database so I've got this one here for
ySus5ZS0b94,open AI vectors and embeddings are easy
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll copy the input as well as the
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding straight into single store wow
ySus5ZS0b94,it always surprises me how many
ySus5ZS0b94,dimensions there are to this embedding
ySus5ZS0b94,now I'll enter this and insert this row
ySus5ZS0b94,heading back to the database I'll be
ySus5ZS0b94,able to view the sample data and here it
ySus5ZS0b94,is let me try this one more time with a
ySus5ZS0b94,larger example I've got this one here
ySus5ZS0b94,which was the document which had quite a
ySus5ZS0b94,few different characters in here and the
ySus5ZS0b94,process is more or less the same copying
ySus5ZS0b94,out the text then copying the embedding
ySus5ZS0b94,vector and then finally inserting the
ySus5ZS0b94,row into single store let me show you
ySus5ZS0b94,the three rows that now exist that are
ySus5ZS0b94,quite simple but enough for us to start
ySus5ZS0b94,performing searches searching a vector
ySus5ZS0b94,database for embeddings is actually
ySus5ZS0b94,quite simple the first step is to
ySus5ZS0b94,identify what you want to search for so
ySus5ZS0b94,for example we might want to search for
ySus5ZS0b94,anything related to open AI next we have
ySus5ZS0b94,to create an embedding for our search
ySus5ZS0b94,term in this case we would create an
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding for the word open Ai and then
ySus5ZS0b94,finally we would perform a search in the
ySus5ZS0b94,database against the existing embeddings
ySus5ZS0b94,this would return a list with the
ySus5ZS0b94,closest similarity being at the top
ySus5ZS0b94,heading over to the SQL editor I'm going
ySus5ZS0b94,to write this query by writing the
ySus5ZS0b94,following select text which is one of
ySus5ZS0b94,the columns then I'm going to pass in
ySus5ZS0b94,dot underscore product passing in the
ySus5ZS0b94,next column the vector column and adding
ySus5ZS0b94,in Json underscore array underscore pack
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll leave this empty for now but this
ySus5ZS0b94,is where I'll add the array and then
ySus5ZS0b94,convert this to a score that we can use
ySus5ZS0b94,for ranking results next I'll grab this
ySus5ZS0b94,from my Vector table and I'll order it
ySus5ZS0b94,by the score in descending order this
ySus5ZS0b94,will be limited to just Five results now
ySus5ZS0b94,opening up Postman I'm going to need to
ySus5ZS0b94,create an amending to search so the
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding term I want to use is open AI
ySus5ZS0b94,this will create the vector here which
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm going to copy out and then paste
ySus5ZS0b94,back into the SQL query the SQL query
ySus5ZS0b94,will use this as a reference and use it
ySus5ZS0b94,as part of the scoring system so let me
ySus5ZS0b94,run this and show you the results here's
ySus5ZS0b94,our successful search of the vector
ySus5ZS0b94,database against the term open Ai and
ySus5ZS0b94,all the other vectors that are similar
ySus5ZS0b94,to it the scores are ratings essentially
ySus5ZS0b94,how highly ranked it is is how similar
ySus5ZS0b94,it is to the content already in the
ySus5ZS0b94,database I could create another search
ySus5ZS0b94,term embedding here called hello Earth
ySus5ZS0b94,and use the vector that I receive as a
ySus5ZS0b94,search and have a try to see if this
ySus5ZS0b94,changes up the results pasting this into
ySus5ZS0b94,the query here on the vector database
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll find that now hello world is the
ySus5ZS0b94,top ranking result built with a much
ySus5ZS0b94,higher score than all the others and
ySus5ZS0b94,this is fundamentally how Vector
ySus5ZS0b94,searching Works in this part of the
ySus5ZS0b94,video I'm going to create an actual
ySus5ZS0b94,function using JavaScript on node.js to
ySus5ZS0b94,interact with embeddings first let me
ySus5ZS0b94,create a brand new folder called openai
ySus5ZS0b94,vectors and embeddings next I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,do a fetched request to the open AI API
ySus5ZS0b94,so here inside of the file index.js I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to write in a small header here to
ySus5ZS0b94,connect up to open AI in this header I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to make the content type as
ySus5ZS0b94,application Json and I'm also going to
ySus5ZS0b94,pass in the authorization which will
ySus5ZS0b94,have the key here as a barrier token
ySus5ZS0b94,similar to what I did inside of Postman
ySus5ZS0b94,the safe and secure way to do this is
ySus5ZS0b94,using an environmental key but for this
ySus5ZS0b94,example here I'm just going to pass in
ySus5ZS0b94,my token straight away to make a life
ySus5ZS0b94,easier for myself this of course is
ySus5ZS0b94,something you want to keep secure and
ySus5ZS0b94,after this video I'll be deleting this
ySus5ZS0b94,key now Now to create the function I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to create a async function and I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to call this create embedding it's
ySus5ZS0b94,only going to pass in one item which
ySus5ZS0b94,will be the text and this is the text
ySus5ZS0b94,that we're going to embed and I'm going
ySus5ZS0b94,to use this to pass to an API now I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,not going to use axios or anything like
ySus5ZS0b94,that I'm just doing a regular fetch
ySus5ZS0b94,command here so I'm going to pass in let
ySus5ZS0b94,response equals await fetch I'm going to
ySus5ZS0b94,pass in the URL for open ai's version 1
ySus5ZS0b94,of embeddings which is just a forward
ySus5ZS0b94,slash V1 forward slash embeddings then
ySus5ZS0b94,I'm going to pass in a couple of
ySus5ZS0b94,parameters this will be a post request
ySus5ZS0b94,so I'll set the method here as a post
ySus5ZS0b94,I'll pass in the headers that we just
ySus5ZS0b94,defined earlier and then finally I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,pass in the body which I'm going to Json
ySus5ZS0b94,stringify and this is the post data
ySus5ZS0b94,there's two items here just like before
ySus5ZS0b94,the model itself which is the text
ySus5ZS0b94,embedding Ada model and the second item
ySus5ZS0b94,is the input which is the text we want
ySus5ZS0b94,to embed next I'll listen to see if
ySus5ZS0b94,there is a response from the server and
ySus5ZS0b94,that response is okay and then I just
ySus5ZS0b94,want to console log it out and return it
ySus5ZS0b94,as part of this function here I'll write
ySus5ZS0b94,response Json so it'll turn it into a
ySus5ZS0b94,Json object and then I'll pull out the
ySus5ZS0b94,data from that I'll console log out the
ySus5ZS0b94,data and then I'll return the data this
ySus5ZS0b94,function is now complete so what I'm
ySus5ZS0b94,going to do is call it to test it out
ySus5ZS0b94,here I'm going to call create embeddings
ySus5ZS0b94,and just pass in hello world next I'll
ySus5ZS0b94,open up the terminal and run node
ySus5ZS0b94,index.js to run this function and just
ySus5ZS0b94,like on Postman this embedding gets
ySus5ZS0b94,returned quite quickly we can see it
ySus5ZS0b94,just over here with the array here on
ySus5ZS0b94,the right hand side and we can plug this
ySus5ZS0b94,into a database next what can we do with
ySus5ZS0b94,this well there's quite a few things you
ySus5ZS0b94,can import a PDF library to read PDFs
ySus5ZS0b94,chunk them and and then store them in a
ySus5ZS0b94,database so that they could be retrieved
ySus5ZS0b94,later and searched through you could do
ySus5ZS0b94,the same for websites or you could do
ySus5ZS0b94,the same for all sorts of things if
ySus5ZS0b94,you've stayed until this point you
ySus5ZS0b94,definitely want to learn more about
ySus5ZS0b94,openai check out my new book teach me
ySus5ZS0b94,open Ai and GPT this is a digital book
ySus5ZS0b94,I've put on sale for 49 that covers
ySus5ZS0b94,everything from how to use the openai
ySus5ZS0b94,API how to do fine tuning and much more
ySus5ZS0b94,in a really visually interesting and fun
ySus5ZS0b94,way it's over 48 pages and it's in the
ySus5ZS0b94,description below these were just the
ySus5ZS0b94,basics if you want to learn more have a
ySus5ZS0b94,look at my video here on integrating
ySus5ZS0b94,openai a database and even a web app
ySus5ZS0b94,together and if you haven't already this
ySus5ZS0b94,is the end of the video so don't forget
ySus5ZS0b94,to hit
